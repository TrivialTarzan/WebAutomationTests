The project involved creating automated test scripts for the websites olx.pl and saucedemo.com using Gherkin, Cucumber, Selenium, and JUnit. My primary goal of this project was to improve proficiency in writing test scripts.

It turned out that OLX uses Captcha to prevent automated scripts from bypassing them. I decided to respect the terms of service of the website and therefore to stop the project. I uploaded the unfinished code, primarily to demonstarte my thought process. 
However, I continued working on saucedemo.com as the website was created with the intention of helping people improve their skills in writing automated test scripts.

Throughout the project, Gherkin was used as the specification language to write test scenarios in a human-readable format. Cucumber was used as the framework for executing these scenarios and generating test reports. Selenium was utilized as the automation tool to interact with the websites' elements, perform actions, and validate expected results. JUnit was used to perform assertions to validate expected behavior.

I implemented the Page Object Pattern, to follow the good practices and to keep everything nice and organized, and Page Factory, to simplify the initialization of web elements and make the code more readable.
